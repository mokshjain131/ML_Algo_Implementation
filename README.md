# ML Algorithm Implementation

This repository contains implementations and explorations of various Machine Learning algorithms using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide clear examples and implementations of fundamental machine learning algorithms. Each algorithm is contained within its own directory with a corresponding Jupyter Notebook.

## Algorithms

Currently, the following algorithms are implemented:

### 1. [Linear Regression](Linear%20Regression/linear_regression.ipynb)
- Implementation of Linear Regression.
- Includes steps for dataset importation, data cleaning, and feature plotting.

### 2. [Logistic Regression](Logistic%20Regression/logistic_regression.ipynb)
- Implementation of Logistic Regression for classification tasks.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter installed.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Common ML libraries (Recommend creating a virtual environment):
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ML_Algo_Implementation
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if a requirements.txt is present, otherwise install manually):
   ```bash
   pip install notebook numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
